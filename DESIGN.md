# Voice Agent Assistant - Design Document

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build an intelligent multi-agent system to control an Android phone using voice commands. The system processes speech in the browser, routes it through a backend to a JADE agent platform, and finally executes the command via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) or other Android interfaces.

## 🔄 Component Flow

1. **Voice Capture & Processing**
   - User speaks command into browser
   - Web Speech API processes speech-to-text
   - Frontend sends command to middleware (REST endpoint)

2. **Command Routing**
   - Middleware receives command
   - Sends to JADE platform (via socket/ACL)
   - VoiceBridgeAgent receives and relays command
   - TaskRouterAgent parses it into a task (e.g., camera, call)
   - PhoneControlAgent runs ADB command on connected Android device

## 💡 Ideas & Technologies

| Feature/Idea | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| JADE Agent Architecture | Modular, distributed intelligence |
| Voice Interface (Web Speech) | Browser-native speech recognition |
| REST Middleware API | Node.js bridge between JS ↔ Java |
| ADB Phone Control | Real-time interaction with Android |
| Command Routing Agent | Parses and delegates logic to relevant handlers |
| Extendable Agent System | Add MusicAgent, SMSAgent, etc. later |
| Modular Frontend | Can be extended to mobile app |

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Prototype
- Build and run JADE agents (Bridge, Router, Control)
- Browser UI with voice capture
- Backend server to receive and forward voice commands
- Bash/ADB script to control the phone

### 🚧 Phase 2: Integration
- Connect UI → Middleware → JADE
- Agents communicate using ACL
- Control phone using adb shell

### 🔜 Phase 3: Expansion
- Add command confirmation and error handling
- Add new agents: SMSAgent, MusicAgent, AppLauncherAgent
- Add intent classification using a simple NLP (or GPT endpoint)

## 🌐 Technologies Used

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | HTML, JS, Web Speech API |
| Backend | Node.js / Express (or Flask) |
| Agent System | JADE (Java) |
| Android | ADB Shell |
| Scripting | Bash, Java |

## 🔧 Implementation Considerations

### JADE Platform
- Agents will communicate using Agent Communication Language (ACL)
- Main container will host the primary agents
- Secondary containers can be distributed for scalability

### Voice Processing
- Use Web Speech API for browser-based recognition
- Consider fallback options for different browsers
- Implement noise filtering and command verification

### ADB Integration
- Implement proper error handling for device connection issues
- Support multiple device connections
- Create command templates for common operations

### Security Considerations
- Implement authentication for API endpoints
- Secure ADB connections
- Consider data privacy for voice commands
